# What is this project?
This project is meant to be a clone of [Huntr](https://huntr.co/). While the app is not meant to be a complete copy of Huntr, 
the goal is to have full implementation of the kanban board.

# What is Huntr?
Huntr is a web application developed to help individuals track and organize their job search. Huntr offers an easy to use interface
in the form of a kanban board to help organize all necessary information. You can learn more about Huntr [here](https://blog.huntr.co/huntr-quickstart-guide/).

# What technologies does this project use?
I began working on this project with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), however, I quickly transitioned over to [React](https://reactjs.org/) as I believed
it would be more beneficial to learn in the long run. Currently, the board has no persistence implemented, but integration with a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
database is planned.
